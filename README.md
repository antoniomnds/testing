Refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.|Proposed changes to a repository submitted by an user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like a request to merge.|Sends the commited changes to a remote repository.|A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.

:exclamation: Rules to live by for commit messages:
- Donâ€™t end your commit message with a period.
- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
- Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged".
- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.
