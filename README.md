#### Commit vs Pull vs Push
- pull requests: proposed changes to a repository submitted by an user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like a request to merge.
- push: sends the commited changes to a remote repository.
- commit: push changes in a file to a remote 

:exclamation: Rules to live by for commit messages:
- Donâ€™t end your commit message with a period.
- Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
- Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged".
- Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.
